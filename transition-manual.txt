THE STACK
	Node.js (nodejs.org) + Express.js (expressjs.org)
		These are the main elements that drive the application
	Most of the application is solely front-end, which is written in Jade (jade-lang.com), which is essentially html-shorthand which lets you embed javascript as well
		These files can be found in the "views" folder of the application. Again, this is most of the code currently contained in the application
