Berkeley’s Star is the first and only singing competition held for UC Berkeley Students in collaboration with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Oakland.  This amazing event hosted by Phi Kappa Psi brings together some of the most talented singers and rappers on campus, selected through a series of exciting and comprehensive auditions, for a night of truly electrifying performances.  The top individuals selected each year compete at a Live Show, hosted at Zellerbach Hall, alongside guest performances from our panel of judges and upcoming talent in the entertainment industry.  Past performers and judges have included Lauren Weintraub, Sam Watters, and Sean Kingston. At the end of the night the judges and the audience select the newest Berkeley’s Star.  In its first year alone Berkeley’s Star not only hosted an event whose caliber has never before been matched on campus, but Phi Kappa Psi also raised over $20,000 in support of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Oakland.
