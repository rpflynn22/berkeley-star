          p.text-left.lead
            | Dedicating nearly his entire life to music and achieving superstardom when he was
            | just 17, Sean Kingston has amassed an untold amount of experience as a singer/songwriter
            | over the years. On his third-full length album Back 2 Life, the 23-year-old builds
            | on that experience by greatly expanding his songwriting role, nixing the multi-producer
            | approach of his last release, and pushing for a fresh new sound. Like his 2007
            | self-titled debut (featuring the double-platinum breakout hit “Beautiful Girls”)
            | and sophomore album Tomorrow (featuring the smash singles “Fire Burning” and
            | “Face Drop”), Back 2 Life fuses reggae, hip-hop, R&B, and electro to create
            | melody-soaked pop. But on Back 2 Life, the singer/songwriter blends his newly
            | strengthened vocals with fiercely inventive effects and hard-hitting live
            | instrumentation—a formula that’s yielded his most passionately inspired
            | work to date.
